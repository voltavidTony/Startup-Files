# Startup Files

## Choose files that open when sublime starts

I keep my to do list and other stuff in text files, and I would like to have them available when I launch Sublime. This plugin takes care of that.

## Features

This plugin has 2 commands and one setting. When Sublime starts, files specified in the setting are opened.

### Commands

  - Open startup files
  - Set startup files

These commands are pretty much self explanatory. Both commands are available via the command palette. To specify the startup files, have only those files opened, and under Preferences choose `Set open files as startup files`.

### Setting

  - Open files at startup

This is a list of all files to be opened at start. You can edit this manually, or set it via the command.

## Installation

This package is accessible via Package Control
